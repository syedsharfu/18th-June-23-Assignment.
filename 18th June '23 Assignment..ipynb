    "logging: Designed for logging messages, which includes recording information about the program's execution, debugging, warnings, errors, etc.\n",
    "Verbosity Control:print: Generally used for basic output and lacks built-in verbosity control.\n",
    "logging: Provides built-in log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) for controlling message verbosity. This allows you to adjust the level of detail in log output dynamically.\n",
    "Destination:print: Outputs messages to the console (standard output).\n",
    "logging: Can output messages to various destinations, including the console, files, external services, etc. This flexibility makes it suitable for logging in production environments.\n",
    "Formatting:print: Limited formatting options; primarily used for basic string concatenation.\n",
    "logging: Supports customizable formatting through formatters, allowing you to specify how log messages are presented, including timestamps, log levels, and additional contextual information.\n",
    "Global Configuration:print: Lacks a centralized configuration mechanism, making it challenging to adjust behavior globally.\n",
    "logging: Provides a centralized configuration system, allowing you to configure logging behavior globally or for specific modules or classes.\n",
    "Log Levels:print: Does not have built-in log levels; all messages are treated equally.\n",
    "logging: Offers different log levels to categorize messages by severity, facilitating better organization and filtering of log output.\n",
    "When to Use logging Over print in a Real-World Application:\n",
    "Production Environments:Use logging in production environments for comprehensive logging, error tracking, and monitoring. It allows you to capture valuable information without exposing it to end-users.\n",
    "Debugging and Development:Use print for quick and temporary debugging during development. It provides a simple way to inspect variable values and control flow.\n",
    "Error Handling:logging is better suited for error handling, as it allows you to categorize errors by severity and log detailed information about exceptions.\n",
    "Verbosity Control:logging is valuable when you need different levels of verbosity in your logs. You can easily switch between DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, and other log levels without modifying the code.\n",
    "Centralized Configuration:logging provides a centralized configuration system, making it easier to manage and adjust log settings globally.\n",
    "Integration with Libraries and Frameworks:Many libraries and frameworks use the logging module, making it seamless to integrate logging across different components of an application.\n",
    "Long-Term Maintenance:For long-term maintenance and scalability, using logging with proper log levels, handlers, and formatters provides a more robust solution.\n",
